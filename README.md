# NODE_TakenEmbedding
Neural ODE using Taken Embedding on long term time series

1. Human Gait Signatures (Stroke vs non-Stroke)
2. Rodent split and tied tread mill data
3. Fly data

Goal: Find self-generatable data using machine learning which will enable us to perform frequency analysis for long timescales.
